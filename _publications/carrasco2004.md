Discussion notes: Caroline also recommends [this](https://PBS-JHU-Journal-Club.github.io/files/StormerMcDonaldHillyard2009.pdf) paper by Stormer, McDonald, & Hillyard on the effects of auditory cuing on percieved contrast. Also discussed: could these effects be explained by post-perceptual (i.e. decision-stage) mechanisms? Read more about [these claims and others](https://PBS-JHU-Journal-Club.github.io/files/Schneider.pdf) by Keith Schneider, as well as [this fantastic reply](https://PBS-JHU-Journal-Club.github.io/files/LingCarrasco.pdf) from Sam Ling and Marisa Carrasco.
