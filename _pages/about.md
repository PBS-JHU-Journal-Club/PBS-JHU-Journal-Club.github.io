I am currently a graduate student within the NYU Department of Psychology and Center for Neural Science, where I am a researcher and lab manager in the Carrasco Lab under Dr. Marisa Carrasco. I'm interested in visual perception and attention, with a particular focus on how perceptual performance differs at isoeccentric peripheral locations around the visual field. My research uses behavioral psychophysics, eye movements, task-evoked pupil responses, and computational modeling to investigate My other research interests include individual and group-level differences in visual perception and attention, attentional modulation in special and developing populations, and visual awareness in the periphery.

Does your child love science, computer games, and learning about the world? Our lab is currently conducting a study to investigate how visual perception develops in children 6-18 years old, and we'd love to invite you to bring your child to participate! If you and your child are interested, sign up for one of our studies by clicking the 'Participate!' tab.
