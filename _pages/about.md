We are a journal club comprised of graduate students in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). We generally meet on Mondays from 4 - 5 PM EST in the graduate student lounge (Ames 131). If you can't make it in person, you can also join us via [Zoom](https://jhubluejays.zoom.us/my/makaelanartker)!
