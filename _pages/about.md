I am a current graduate student within the NYU Department of Psychology and Center for Neural Science. I am a researcher and lab manager in the Carrasco Lab under Dr. Marisa Carrasco, where I study visual perception and attention. I am particularly interested in how the visual system develops in early childhood and adolescence, as well as how covert spatial attention affects perception across the visual field. 

Participate in my research!
