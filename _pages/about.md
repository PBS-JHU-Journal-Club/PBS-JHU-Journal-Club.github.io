I am a vision scientist at NYU studying how visual perception develops in children and adolescents with [Marisa Carrasco] (https://carrascolab.hosting.nyu.edu/people/). 

Beginning in the fall of 2021, Iâ€™ll be joining the labs of [Chaz Firestone](https://perception.jhu.edu/) and [Justin Halberda](https://www.halberdalab.net/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) as a PhD candidate in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.jhu.edu/). 

I am a recent MA graduate at NYU within the [Department of Psychology](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/psychology.html) and [Center for Neural Science](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/cns.html), where I am currently a researcher and lab manager in the [Carrasco Lab](https://carrascolab.hosting.nyu.edu/) with Marisa Carrasco. My research combines behavioral psychophysics, eye movements, and computational methods to study visual perception and attention, with a focus on how perceptual performance differs at isoeccentric peripheral locations around the visual field. My other research interests include [oculomotor markers of expectation and uncertainty](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17160-1), eye-movement (fixational and saccadic) and [pupillometric analyses](https://github.com/carolinemyers/PSA-pupil), [visual attention in special and developing populations](https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.20.11.873), and visual awareness and uncertainty in the periphery. 

Before I fell in love with vision science, I worked with [Pascal Wallisch](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/pascal-wallisch.html) to investigate individual differences in the perception of music. We developed an ML [classification model](https://thesiscommons.org/rhbyq/) capable of predicting participants' ideology based on their music preferences with a strikingly high accuracy, but no, I cannot predict your political affiliation based on whether or not [Pharrell makes you "Happy"](https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/mind-and-brain/music-can-be-used-to-estimate-political-ideology-to-an-accuracy-of-70-researchers-say/).
