I am a current graduate student within the NYU Department of Psychology and Center for Neural Science, where I am a researcher and lab manager in the Carrasco Lab under Dr. Marisa Carrasco. I am interested in visual perception and attention, with a particular focus on how visual perception changes over the course of human development. My other research interests include eye movements and microsaccadic suppression, decision-making and uncertainty, and individual and group-level differences in music perception.

Does your child love science, computer games, and learning about the world? Our lab is currently conducting a study to investigate how visual perception develops in children 6-18 years old, and we'd love to invite you to bring your child to participate! If you and your child are interested, sign up for one of our studies by clicking the 'Participate!' tab.
